## ProgressionTracker

This small MVP web app was designed to assist users with tracking their progress, whether it be a small personal goal like losing weight or a long-term goal like being sober. I wanted users to see their own efforts come to fruition by observing the work they put in.

## Technology used

HTML, CSS, Javascript for the front end
Express, Node.js, EJS, MongoDB for the backend

## Optimizations
There are a lot of things I would've loved to have done differently with this app; however, this was mainly built as an MVP rather than an official application. But I will list off a few optimizations that I will get back to in the near future.

1. Possibly overhaul the entire ui to make it feel more modern and minimal.

2. Add user profile customization.

3. Implement a daily motivational quote modal when users log in.

4. # Future Implementations
<p>
As mention above this app was made using Node.js and EJS as a template language. Personally, I would've loved to use React for the frontend and NEXT.js for the backend.
